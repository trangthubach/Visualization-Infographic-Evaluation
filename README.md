# **Visualization-Infographic-Evaluation**
## **Introduction and Rationale**  
In this project, I evaluated a Infographic on Palestinian children deaths during the Israel’s war on Gaza.

What is the graphic's purpose? Is it designed to present a quick overview, give prompts for deeper analysis, create talking points, etc.?

- The graphic’s purpose is to visualize numbers of Palestinian children deaths during the Israel’s war on Gaza.  
 
Are there chart types or visualization tropes that you recognize?

- The author did not use any chart, but rather actual photo and a calculation. 

Are there custom, novel, or unconventional chart types that you recognize? If so, how do you think they were created?

- Using actual image in black and white, the photographer was there to capture actual children in the classroom. Even though with no chart provided, it delivers the most effective message and evoke readers’ empathy.  

Does “actual data” underlie the graphic? Does it reveal the data? Is the data transparent? Is it properly sourced?

- Yes, the data is transparent and sourced from https://www.aljazeera.com/. 


Who is its audience? How much graphical or statistical literacy will they need to read it? Is this graphic designed for a lay or professional user? Policy makers?

- The audience is us, everyone. The graphic is well designed and written in plain language so that it’s reachable to the public. 

Is there anything that looks misleading? Is anything missing?

- No, the graphic represents perfectly well the data. 

Is it trying to be persuasive? Is there an argument? If so, is it effective? Are the designer's biases clear? How could it be impactful?

- In my opinion, this is an effective design that conveys emotion of the general public. It shows staggering numbers of children deaths by comparing to 550 classrooms. 

Could you create a similar graphic using conventional visualization software? If so, what software application(s) would you use?

- Canva

If you were to redesign elements of it, what might you change? In the box below, create a new drawing (Insert/Drawing/New) and experiment…

- I would change the color of “550” to bold red because red represents anger, urgency, warning, death and a call to immediate action.
